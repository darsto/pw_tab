# TAB-select functionality for older PW versions

Select nearest monster with your TAB key!

The projects consists of 2 elements: dll and an injector application.
DLL is where all the TAB functionality is implemented and it could be
injected to a PW process with any third-party injector app, but to keep
the usage simple, there is also a minimal injector included in this package.

Specifically, we've got pw_tab.dll and elementclient.exe. The exe is
responsible for starting a PW process and injecting pw_tab.dll into it.
It is named this way so that it will be run by the PW patcher as the
usual elementclient.exe.

# Getting started

1. This was tested on MinGW32. To install it, follow the instructions on
   http://mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started -> download mingw-get-setup.exe
   from there and run it. The project might also compile in Visual Studio,
   but I don't have it and I don't want to.

2. MinGW packages - during MinGW installation, on the package list view
   make sure to select the following:

      * mingw32-gcc-bin (c compiler)
      * mingw32-w32api-dev (windows api)
      * msys-base-bin (handy unix shell)
      * msys-make-bin (for makefiles)

3. Copy the project dir to C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\<your_name>

4. Run MSYS. By default it's located in C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat
   Then navigate to the project directory you just copied

5. Build the dll and exe by executing the following command
   $ make

6. In the PW dir, rename the original elementclient.exe to game.exe.
   Then copy the newly built pw_tab.dll and elementclient.exe to the
   same dir. The new elementclient.exe will internally execute game.exe
   and launch the game.
